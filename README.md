Summary of Program: My program essentially asks the user if they want a random fact about a certain topic. If the user rejects the program by typing 'no', then the program will ask the user if they want a different random fact/quote. If the user keeps rejecting the program by typing 'no' the program will get 'irritated' and end.

Most Challenging topic in the course: Requests/APIs
